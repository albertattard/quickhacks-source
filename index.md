# Quickhacks
{: .fs-9 }

Many times I had to look for an old example where I did something similar, like create an S3 bucket using Terraform. I
have decided to compile a list of code fragments and short examples and called this compilation _quickhacks_. I got the
name from the [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/) game. As
a [netrunner](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Netrunner) you can use _quickhacks_ to defeat your challenges and
proceed. I love that game despite its **many** flaws.

The _quickhacks_ are not meant to be a tutorial nor to provide detailed descriptions. Instead, these are meant to be a
quick reference of code fragments.
