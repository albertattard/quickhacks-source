## Tricorder

> _Static analysis tools help developers find bugs, improve code readability, and ensure consistent style across a 
project. However, these tools can be difficult to smoothly integrate with each other and into the developer workflow, 
particularly when scaling to large codebases. We present Tricorder, a program analysis platform aimed at building a 
data-driven ecosystem around program analysis. We present a set of guiding principles for our program analysis tools 
and a scalable architecture for an analysis platform implementing these principles. We include an empirical, in-situ 
evaluation of the tool as it is used by developers across Google that shows the usefulness and impact of the platform._
