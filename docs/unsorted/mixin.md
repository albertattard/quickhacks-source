## Mixin

> _In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin (or mix-in) is a class that contains methods for use by other 
classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the 
mixin's methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being "included" rather than "inherited"._
