## Stroop effect

> _In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli._

> _The effect has been used to create a psychological test (the Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice 
and investigation._

> _A basic task that demonstrates this effect occurs when there is a mismatch between the name of a color (e.g., 
"blue", "green", or "red") and the color it is printed on (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink). 
When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors when the color of the ink does not 
match the name of the color._
